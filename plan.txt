1) Write a one paragraph summary of the program in your own words.  What is being asked of you?  What will you implement in this assignment?
In this project, we will be implementing another word game where two players have a set of letters and have to go back and forth entering valid words from the set
to win the round. The last player to submit a valid word before the timer runs out wins the round. The first player to submit an invalid word loses the round.
Win a majority of the rounds to win the game. This game will require multiple players to be able to connect to a server via a socket with the server acting as 
the administrator of the game, sending each player the information of the game as needed.

2) What you anticipate being the most challenging aspect of the assignment?
We are anticipating that implementing the time limits to cut off the players will be the most challenging
aspect of this assignment. We already have the sending and receiving through sockets from the previous project down 
pretty soundly so game logic and adding the timed aspect will be difficult.


3) Give a list of at least three resources you plan to draw from if you get stuck on something.
Man pages, previous C assignments, Slack, socket lab, project 1, Professor Mare

4) What is your plan for meeting to finish this program (e.g. ``every Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 3pm-5pm until it's done.).
We are planning on meeting Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday anytime after class. While staying communicative of eachother's tentative 
schedules, of course.
